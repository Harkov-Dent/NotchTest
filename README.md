# NotchTest
Notch Notifications for pocophone f1


Test application for notification in notch in pocophone f1.
There's still no useful UI, sorry but it's only to define wheter this app is useful and runnable on multiple devices.
It shows 7 icons, and in case a more icon.

Instructions

1- Download app  ![alt text](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kNpnNuICry0RKnUMmsGsNSGpiNTzvpnX) (this was tricky!:))

2- When open it automatically launches Overlay request and notification request, you must accept them both. 

(The app is named NotchTest, the one with the bell)

3- Now it opens and it asks for storage permission (Needed for debbugging purposes, explained later), now it should show your notifications (hopefully)

4- Go to settings-> Installed apps-> search Notch Test (still the bell) and grant boot permission and remove battery limitations.

The app should now work after a proper reboot.

If you kill the app after the launch it may not restart, dont'ask me why, i'm still figuring it out.

Known bugs

1- At the moment is only white coloured

2- At the moment it does not close when going fullscreen, i've got an accessibility service almost ready for that.

3- In the notification you find a persistent notification of "NotchTest shown over other apps", I think I can't do anything about this.

4- There might be some application disturbing it, for example I found that Fluid N.G made the screen flicker.
    I can solve (hopefully) this if you send a mail to me (andrea.zanini02@gmail.com) with Subject "Notch Test Issue" and attached the txt file you can find in:
    Internal Storage/zaniniLog/notchTestLog.txt

5 -We will find more for sure.
